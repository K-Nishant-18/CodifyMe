# NotebookLM Audio Overview Instructions

To get the best "Deep Dive" audio for your video ad, use the **"Customize"** feature in the Audio Overview section of NotebookLM.

## 1. The Prompt
Paste this into the **"Give the hosts instructions"** box before generating:

> **Tone:** High-energy, intense, and slightly "tech-dystopian" but inspiring. Like a reveal of a secret weapon.
>
> **Structure:**
> 1.  **Start with the Pain:** Open by discussing "Tutorial Hell" and the anxiety of applying to jobs without knowing if you're ready. It should feel relatable and stressful.
> 2.  **The Reveal:** Introduce "CodifyMe" as a "System Override" or a "Placement Operating System." It's not a course; it's a tool to dominate.
> 3.  **The "Aha!" Moment:** Focus heavily on the **CrackScore**. Discuss it like it's a credit score for your career—a single number that tells you the truth.
> 4.  **The "Brutal" Feature:** Talk about the AI Interview Simulator. Emphasize that it's "brutally honest" and doesn't sugarcoat feedback.
> 5.  **Conclusion:** End with the tagline "Codify Your Future by using CodifyMe." Make it sound like a movement.

## 2. What the AI Hosts Should Focus On (Key Themes)

If you are chatting with the AI to refine the content before generating, or if you want to understand the angle:

*   **The Enemy:** "Guesswork." Students guessing if they are ready, guessing what to study, guessing why they got rejected.
*   **The Hero:** "Data." CodifyMe replaces guessing with hard data (CrackScore, Analytics).
*   **The Vibe:** Serious, professional, competitive. This isn't for hobbyists; it's for people who want to get hired at top tech companies.
*   **The Aesthetic:** Mention the "Neo-Brutalism" design—it's raw and functional because that's what the job market is like.

## 3. Post-Generation Tips
*   **Audio Slicing:** The generated audio will likely be 5-10 minutes. You only need 45-60 seconds.
*   **Best Clips to Cut:**
    *   The intro where they describe the problem (0:00 - 0:15 in your video).
    *   The explanation of the "CrackScore" (0:15 - 0:25).
    *   The "Brutal" interview simulator description (0:28 - 0:38).
    *   The final tagline (0:45 - 0:50).
